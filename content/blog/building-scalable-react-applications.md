# Building Scalable React Applications

As React applications grow in complexity, maintaining clean and scalable code becomes increasingly challenging. In this post, I'll share some best practices I've learned from building large-scale React applications.

## Component Architecture

### Keep Components Small and Focused

One of the most important principles is to keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility. This makes them easier to test, debug, and reuse.

\`\`\`jsx
// Good: Focused component
function UserAvatar({ user, size = "medium" }) {
  return (
    <img
      src={user.avatar || "/placeholder.svg"}
      alt={`${user.name}'s avatar`}
      className={`avatar avatar-${size}`}
    />
  )
}

// Bad: Component doing too much
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  // Handles avatar, user info, settings, notifications...
  // This component is doing too much!
}
\`\`\`

### Use Composition Over Inheritance

React's composition model is powerful. Instead of creating complex inheritance hierarchies, compose smaller components together.

\`\`\`jsx
function Card({ children, className }) {
  return <div className={`card ${className}`}>{children}</div>
}

function CardHeader({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-header">{children}</div>
}

function CardBody({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-body">{children}</div>
}

// Usage
function UserCard({ user }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <UserAvatar user={user} />
        <h3>{user.name}</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <p>{user.bio}</p>
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## State Management

### Choose the Right Tool for the Job

Not every application needs Redux or Zustand. Start with React's built-in state management and only add complexity when needed.

- **Local state**: `useState` for component-specific state
- **Shared state**: Context API for theme, user auth, etc.
- **Complex state**: Redux, Zustand, or Jotai for complex applications

### Keep State Close to Where It's Used

Don't lift state up unnecessarily. Keep state as close as possible to the components that use it.

\`\`\`jsx
// Good: State is local to the component that needs it
function SearchInput({ onSearch }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("")
  
  return (
    <input
      value={query}
      onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && onSearch(query)}
    />
  )
}

// Bad: Lifting state unnecessarily
function App() {
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("")
  // This state is only used by SearchInput, keep it there!
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

### Use React.memo Wisely

`React.memo` can help prevent unnecessary re-renders, but use it judiciously. Profile first, optimize second.

\`\`\`jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ data, onUpdate }) {
  // Expensive calculations or rendering
  return <div>{/* Complex UI */}</div>
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison function if needed
  return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id
})
\`\`\`

### Optimize Bundle Size

- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Analyze your bundle with tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Remove unused dependencies

\`\`\`jsx
// Code splitting with React.lazy
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'))

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dashboard />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Testing Strategy

### Test Behavior, Not Implementation

Focus on testing what your components do, not how they do it.

\`\`\`jsx
// Good: Testing behavior
test('should display user name when user is provided', () => {
  render(<UserProfile user={{ name: 'John Doe' }} />)
  expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// Bad: Testing implementation details
test('should call useState with initial value', () => {
  // This test is too focused on implementation
})
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Building scalable React applications is about making thoughtful architectural decisions early and maintaining discipline as your codebase grows. Focus on component composition, appropriate state management, and testing the right things.

Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is ignoring performance until it's too late. Find the right balance for your application and team.
